Serial To Ethernet Module

The Serial to Ethernet Converter provides a means of accessing the UART on
a Stellaris device via a network connection.  The UART can be connected to
the UART on a non-networked device, providing the ability to access the
device via a network.  This can be useful to overcome the cable length
limitations of a UART connection (in fact, the cable can become thousands
of miles long) and to provide networking capability to existing devices
without modifying the device's operation.

The converter can be configured to use a static IP configuration or to use
DHCP to obtain its IP configuration.  Since the converter is providing a
telnet server, the effective use of DHCP requires a reservation in the DHCP
server so that the converter gets the same IP address each time it is
connected to the network.
